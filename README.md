# Serialization-and-Deserialization
This repository contains examples and best practices for serialization and deserialization processes in Java

# Overview
**Serialization:** Converts an object into a storable or transmittable format like JSON or XML. This allows data to be saved to a file or sent over a network.  

**Deserialization:** Converts serialized data back into an object, enabling applications to read data from a file or network and use it as if it were created within the app.
